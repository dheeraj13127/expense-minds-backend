> This application is ready to be deployed to production. I had used Vercel to deploy both frontend and backend. Since this application involves websockets, the Vercel doesn't support it. Also I couldn't find any free hosting services for backend and I have decided not to host the application.You can checkout the backend code here: https://github.com/dheeraj13127/expense-minds-backend
